systemd stuff / initrc stuff was kind of complicated
not a lot of great examples, tried to use crond as an example
getting things to run in scope is kind of tricky with relative scope and stuff
weird behavior where it won't stop and will block, preventing all next calls
had to switch to start_daemon, that was wonky and syntax was strange
